Cheddar is a hard cowâ€™s-milk cheese named for the district of its origin in the southwestern county of Somerset, England.
The cheese, a light orange-yellow in colour, is wrapped in thin muslin and coated with wax.
It is aged a minimum of three to six months, preferably one and one-half to two years.
Its mellow, rich flavour becomes more intense with age but should not be bitter.
